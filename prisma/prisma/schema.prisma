/**
 * based on your Prisma schema:
 * User has a one-to-many relationship with course, meaning one user can have multiple courses.
 * course has a many-to-one relationship with User, meaning each course belongs to a single user.
 * How the Relationship Works
 * In User model, the course field is an array (course[]) → This means one user can have multiple courses.
 * In course model, the User field represents a single user (User?) → This means each course belongs to only one user.
 * The userId field in course acts as a foreign key referring to User.id.
